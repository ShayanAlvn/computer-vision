## part 3 of Image Fundomentals
in this whole chaper I learned about RGB and find out all the colors are a combination of these three colors 
"aspect ratio" is the other important thing here .
if you divide width and hight you will have it 
now let's have a look at the code 
cv2.imread--->this will loads an image from a file
cv2.imshow--->this will shows you the image 
cv2.waitKey(0)--->if you put 0 you will have image up to when you click 
and if you want you can put a number based on millisecond and after that the image will disappear
